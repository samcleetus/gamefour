# Sam's games
This repo contains one of the games I wrote -- **Meanies Upon Us**.

## Meanies Upon Us
This is the first game I wrote from scratch, using all the skills I've learned following examples I followed.

## How to Play
- Use W-A-S-D keys to move (Up, Left, Down and Right respectively)
- Evade the *Zombies, Gremlins and Giants* and **click** on the baddies to kill them

## Innovations
- I learned to create multiple rooms, so try that out!
